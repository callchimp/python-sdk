All endpoints accepts a header named `x-api-key`. To get started follow the below steps:    1. Login to callchimp dashboard.   2. Click on your profile on the top-right corner.   3. Click on Settings.   4. On the settings page, click on `API Keys` tab.   5. Click on `Create` button, add a name and an expiry date and click on `Add`.   6. An API Key will be generated, please save the key somewhere safe as it won't be shown again!   7. You can use the API Key directly here in this playground to test out the APIs.
