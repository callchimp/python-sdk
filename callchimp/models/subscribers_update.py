Click on Settings.   4. On the settings page, click on `API Keys` from the left sidebar.   5. Click on `Add new` button, add an expiry date and click on `Add`.   6. An API Key will be generated, please save the key somewhere safe as it won't be shown again!   7. You can use the API Key directly here in this playground to test out the APIs.
